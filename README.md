This is a simple setup script for my zsh environment.
Feel free to use it yourself.

Just run `curl -Ss https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OneAutumnMango/zsh-configs/master/setup.sh | sh`

You can optionally set `zsh` as the default shell `chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh`
or `sudo chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh $USER` if using passwordless sudo
